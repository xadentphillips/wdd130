    <h2>Xaden Phillips</h2>
    <p>My name is Xaden Phillips; I am from Kuna, Idaho.  I am the fourth of nine children.  I served my mission in the greatest country in the world, Sierra Leone.  It is in West Africa, and I love it so much I went back this summer to go teach English and math to grades 4-9.  I am a cybersecurity major, and this is my third semester at BYUI.  I love rock climbing and go frequently to the Rock Gym here in Rexburg.  One fun fact about me is that I once ate rice everyday for 14 months without a break.</p>
