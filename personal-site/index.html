                <h3>Sierra Leone at a Glance</h3>
                <p>Sierra Leone is one of the poorest, least developed countries in the world. Sierra Leone is ranked
                    184 out of 193 countries on the human development index. Sierra Leoneans make on average less than
                    $50 a month to support their families. Between July of 2021 and July of 2023, Sierra Leone had more
                    than 100% inflation, tanking the value of wages and sending stable families into instability and
                    struggling families into extreme hardship.</p>

                <h3>A Hand Up</h3>
                <p>Sierra Leoneans are a very hardworking people; they have to be if they want to survive and have
                    families. With a hand up to gain some kind of skilled labor training or education, they are able to
                    rise above their circumstances and help their families end the cycle of poverty.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The Sierra Leone Sponsorship Program is dedicated to helping Sierra Leoneans help themselves. From
                getting captial to start a small business, to feeding families down on their luck, donors to the Sierra
                Leonean Sponsorship Program are changing lives everday. The Sierra Leonean Sponsorship Program finds
                trustworthy individuals in Sierra Leone with a desire to serve their families and communities and raises
                money through donations to fund their causes. What seem like small donations in the first world make a
                big difference in the fourth world. (Yes you read that right, Sierra Leone is a fourth world country).
                Donations as little as $0.50 can buy a pound of rice for a struggling family. We hope that within the
                next 70 years, we can help Sierra Leone to produce 100% of its own food supply. Helping this nation
                become independent from expensive imports that so many individuals and businesses depend on would be a
                big step towards economic stability and growth.</p>
