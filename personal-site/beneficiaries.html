                <h3>The Bakar Family</h3>
                <p>Michael Bakar was a teacher providing for his wife Hawa and his daughter Susan.  He did not earn a lot, but it was enough to make a living.  When the private school he worked at went under and started having to rely on government subsidies instead, his pay was cut substantially, and he was left earning less than $15 a month or $180 a year.  He and his family frequently went hungry and they would ship Susan off to live with relatives when school was not in session to make sure she was fed.  Thanks to donors, the Sierra Leone Sponsorship Program was able to feed Michael and his family while he was searching for another job.</p>

                <h3>Kadiatu Conteh</h3>
                <p>Kadiatu is a young woman who helped support her family for most of her life.  When she came home from school, rather than studying or resting, she would go and sell.  She made little cookies or fried peanuts to go sell to hungry construction and automotive workers in her community.  Living high in the hills of Freetown she would usually have over 1000 feet of elevation change while selling.  Donors to the Sierra Leone Sponsorship Program made it possible for Kadiatu to attend catering school.  She is now much better able to contribute to her family's income.  She is still deiciding what career path she would like to take, but she will now be able to afford whatever schooling she chooses because of her catering work.</p>

                <h3>Margaret Kamara</h3>
                <p>Margaret is a hard working mother of three who tries her best to provide for her family.  She has sacrificed to put food on the table and keep her children in school.  Paying the fees for her daughter's final government examination, the only entry requirement for college, left the family behind.  One of her children who was only 100lbs to begin with lost 20lbs in one month.  The Sierra Leone Sponsorship Program was able to help Margaret and her family in this trying time.  Donations helped us to put food on her table, those who heard her children's cries of joy will forever be touched by this incredible woman and her family.</p>
