        This site is going to be set up to advertise for a humanitarian organization I started.  People we advertise to will visit our site, and our goal with the site is to convince them that these individuals are worth donating to.  It will have some facts about Sierra Leone and tell people about the country and what living conditions are like.  It will also tell about our organization and what our mission is.  We will have pictures along with the facts to compare Sierra Leone with other countries in the world.  Visitors to our website will probably not know very much about our organization, so they will be wondering who we are, why we do what we do, and how they can help.  They will want to know how to donate and what their donations will accomplish.  Visitors will come to our site because we are unique, and we have real stories from people that live in Sierra Leone.  We can show them what actual people live like with statistics to back it up, but also pictures to help them understand what these people live like.  Our goal will be to convince visitors that they can make a difference and that they should.

      <h3>Individuals in need</h3>
      <p>
        This page will have lists of current individuals that need assistance.  It will detail the projects visitors can donate to and what they are trying to accomplish.  We will have information about donating and the method.  It will have links to our social media pages and ask visitors to spread the message.  Visitors to this page will want to know what they can do to help.  They will be wondering what difference they can make, and we will try to answer the question of why they should donate.  We will describe the amount of difference that individual donations can cause.  We will show what the effect of one dollar on any project would do, such as how much rice it will buy, how many days of trade school, or how much it will help someone start a business.  We will have pictures of all of the individuals we are trying to help as well as fundraising goals for their projects.  We talk about what the futures of these individuals look like now versus what they could look like with some small donations.  We would also like to have a small biography about each individual.  Rather than just talking about what they need help with, we would like to tell them about each person.

      <h3>Previous Beneficiaries</h3>
      <p>
        This page will show past beneficiaries of the program.  We will have stories of the individuals who donors have been able to help and what the difference in their lives has been.  Our program has helped multiple people to afford things such as trade school, food for struggling families, and help in job searches.  On this page we will be showing visitors how wide ranging our organization’s help can be and what their money can do.  We will have pictures of previous beneficiaries and some of what they have been able to do with the help they have received.  Visitors on this page will be wondering what we have accomplished in the past.  We may have videos of individuals speaking about the difference that his help has made for them and their families.  This page will also speak about what in general the organization does and the projects we take on.  It will discuss how beneficiaries are chosen and our organization’s personal connection to them.  We will share a little bit about their families and some of the struggles they were going through before they received aid.
