            <h1>Individuals in Need</h1>
            <p>The Sierra Leone Sponsorship Program does on the ground work to find individuals in need.  We use Americans who live or have lived in Sierra Leone to get in contact with honest people with aspirations of a better life.  We hope you will be touched by the stories of these beautiful people who just want a better life for themselves and for their children.</p>

                <h3>Marie Kamara</h3>
                <p>Marie is a bright young woman with a wondeful future ahead of her.  She is intelligent and at the top of her school class.  She has not had to repeat any grades or government examinations, which is quite rare in Sierra Leone.  She hopes to someday become a nurse and be able to care for those in need as well as her family.  Her mother has made tremendous sacrifice for Marie's education, and the family has gone without food at times, sacrificing the present for their hope in the future.  Marie wants to take a six month baking course to help provide for her mother, younger brother, older sister, and niece as well as earning some money to save for university fees.  To help her take this baking course, we are working to earn her $150.</p>

                <h3>Daniel Saidu</h3>
                <p>Daniel is an extremely gifted young man.  Without any formal lessons, he has learned to play the guitar, piano, and drums.  Daniel lives in the second largest city in Sierra Leone, but the city's only music school closed after a benefactor withdrew their support.  Daniel hopes to reopen the school, and with a small investment purchase instruments for the school.  He already gives lessons to individuals with their own instruments and has a big customer base of people who are interested in learning but have nowhere to go.  He has found a kind pastor who has agreed to let Daniel use his church to give lessons.  Daniel loves to serve his community and plays music for his church, even volunteering to help with choir practice and other assignments outside of normal services.  We are trying to raise $250 for him to buy a bass guitar, drum set, and electric keyboard.</p>
